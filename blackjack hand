// Write a program that scores a blackjack hand. In blackjack,
// a player receives from two to five cards. The cards 2 through
// 10 are scored as 2 through 10 points each. The face cards—jack,
// queen, and king—are scored as 10 points. The goal is to come
// as close to a score of 21 as possible without going over 21.
// Hence, any score over 21 is called “busted.” The ace can
// count as either 1 or 11, whichever is better for the user. For
// example, an ace and a 10 can be scored as either 11 or 21. Since
// 21 is a better score, this hand is scored as 21. An ace and two
// 8s can be scored as either 17 or 27. Since 27 is a “busted” score,
// this hand is scored as 17.The user is asked how many cards she or he has, and the user responds with
// one of the integers 2, 3, 4, or 5. The user is then asked for the card values. Card
// values are 2 through 10, jack, queen, king, and ace. A good way to handle
// input is to use the type char so that the card input 2, for example, is read as the
// character '2', rather than as the number 2. Input the values 2 through 9 as the
// characters '2' through '9'. Input the values 10, jack, queen, king, and ace as
// the characters 't', 'j', 'q', 'k', and 'a'. (Of course, the user does not type in
// the single quotes.) Be sure to allow upper- as well as lowercase letters as input.
// After reading in the values, the program should convert them from character
// values to numeric card scores, taking special care for aces. The output is
// either a number between 2 and 21 (inclusive) or the word Busted. You are
// likely to have one or more long multiway branches that use a switch statement
// or nested if-else statement. Your program should include a loop that
// lets the user repeat this calculation until the user says she or he is done.
