//The program asks the user if he or she wants to convert lengths or
//weights. If the user chooses lengths, then the program asks the user if he
//or she wants to convert from feet and inches to meters and centimeters
//or from meters and centimeters to feet and inches. If the user chooses
//weights, a similar question about pounds, ounces, kilograms, and grams
//is asked. The program then performs the desired conversion. Have the
//user respond by typing the integer 1 for one type of conversion and 2
//for the other. The program reads the userâ€™s answer and then executes an
//if-else statement. Each branch of the if-else statement will be a function
//call. The two functions called in the if-else statement will have function
//definitions that are very similar to the programs for Practice Programs 4
//and 7. Thus, these functions will be function definitions that call other
//functions in their function bodies; however, they will be very easy to write
//by adapting the programs you wrote for Practice Programs 4 and 7.
